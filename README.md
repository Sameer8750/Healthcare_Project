# Transforming Raw Hospital Data into Smarter Decisions

## 📊 Project Overview:
This project is built using real hospital data from over 40,000+ patients, spanning clinical, demographic, and financial domains. It aims to transform complex healthcare data into interactive insights that help hospitals, insurers, and analysts optimize care delivery, reduce costs, and improve patient outcomes.

## 📈 Key Features of the Dashboard:

**1. Executive Summary View:**

- Monitor admissions, treatment durations, and cost patterns

- Analyze insurer impact on billing and length of stay

- Understand year-over-year healthcare trends

**2. Patient Profile & Journey Analysis:**

- Dive into gender, age, blood group, and condition-level breakdowns

- View test results by medication and track demographic health risks

- Drill down into high-risk groups by combining filters dynamically

**3. Hospital Operations Insights:**

- Measure cost-efficiency, diagnostic performance, and emergency loads

- Explore medication efficiency and insurer distribution via advanced visuals

- Use dynamic filters like admission type, year, and hospital to analyze patterns

**4. Root Cause Exploration (Decomposition Tree):**

- Uncover the ‘why’ behind admission spikes or chronic condition clusters

- Break down patient journeys by age, blood type, gender, and condition

- Identify operational pressure points and plan resources efficiently

## 🔬 What Makes It Unique?
This dashboard goes beyond surface metrics. Every filter unlocks deeper understanding — whether it’s why a certain insurer covers more chronic cases or how blood group patterns reveal hidden risks in elderly care.
It’s not just data. It’s healthcare intelligence — built for real-world decisions.

## 📊 Dashboard Preview:


## 🚀 Key Metrics Tracked:
Total Admissions | Avg. Length of Stay | Emergency Load %

Billing by Condition | Insurance Share (2019–2024)

Diagnostic Accuracy | Treatment Cost by Medication

Root Cause Drivers (Gender, Age, Blood Group, Condition)

## ⚙️ Built With:
- Power BI (Data Modeling + DAX)

- ZoomCharts (for custom visuals & interactivity)

- Public Datasets (Healthcare + Kaggle-based)

- Real-time filtering | Scenario walkthroughs | Story-driven narration

## 🛠️ Setup and Usage:

**1. Clone the repository :**

```bash

```

## 💡 Insights:
- Blue Cross billing trends highlight a focus on chronic conditions like Hypertension and Diabetes.

- Insurance shifts over time reveal changing coverage roles across conditions and hospitals.

- Medication-wise test outcomes expose critical diagnostic gaps in specific hospitals.

- Decomposition analysis pinpoints Urgent admissions as primary care drivers across networks.

## 💡 Project Scope & Impact:
**This dashboard can be scaled across:**

- Multi-location hospital networks

- Insurance optimization platforms

- Policy impact modeling

- Predictive health systems

- Whether it’s flagging early warning signs, allocating ICU beds, or auditing chronic care claims — this dashboard enables smarter, faster, more human decisions.

##📌 Conclusion:
This dashboard goes beyond numbers — it empowers smarter, faster, and more informed healthcare decisions by turning real-world data into actionable insights for hospitals, insurers, and analysts alike.
